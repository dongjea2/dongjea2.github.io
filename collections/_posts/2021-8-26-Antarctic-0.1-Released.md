In early this July I wanted to start a blog and chose Jekyll as the framework to begin with. After looking through several collections of Jekyll themes without satisfaction, I decided to build one by myself. Previously I have written UI for some personal projects from scratch, with little code being reused. Getting tired of repeating same task for each new projects, I planned to build an unified UI framework apply to all scenario. Through the development process I gradually recognized the original goal is rather impractical, and finally I got something quite different from my initial idea, that is [Glacial Design](https://github.com/SdtElectronics/GlacialDesign). Fortunately it is still a good framework for sites aggregating contents, and its first application is this Jekyll theme, [Antarctica](https://github.com/SdtElectronics/jekyll-theme-antarctica).


As a new-born project it will inevitably have problems and defects. The development will be a progressive process and continuous effort will be devoted to improve the quality and add new features. If you found a bug or have features request, please don't hesitate to raise an issue, or even better if you want to create a PR, it is always welcomed!
